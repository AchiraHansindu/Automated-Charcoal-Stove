# Temperature Controlled Automated Charcoal Stove

The Temperature Controlled Automated Charcoal Stove is a sustainable cooking solution designed to address the increasing demand for affordable and reliable alternatives to gas and electric stoves. It leverages innovative technology to offer precise temperature control and multiple cooking modes, making it a valuable addition to any kitchen.

## Project Overview

Amidst rising gas prices and concerns about sustainable energy usage, our charcoal stove presents a cost-effective and efficient alternative. By controlling the oxygen supply with an automated fan system, it ensures consistent temperatures, promoting an even cooking experience. This system, powered by a rechargeable battery, supports uninterrupted operation, even during power outages.
